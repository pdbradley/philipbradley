I've been mentoring at the [The Firehose Project](http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/) for a while and the other day I volunteered to give a short talk on refactoring using "extract method".  I'm not sure if that is a proper noun or not.

Extract method is a great technique, especially for beginners, to reduce the mental clutter of your code.
