I've made no secret of my love of the egg. In fact my [favorite
restaurant](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Break+of+Dawn/@33.6078014,-117.7034726,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x81db0752fb04aa73!8m2!3d33.6078014!4d-117.7034726) makes a point of quietly including eggs in some way in nearly all their entrees.

I approve of any [egg homage](https://www.eatout.co.za/article/ode-eggs/) and won't bore you with any of that. You wouldn't be here unless you agree. Let's get to work.

Terminology for the uninitiated:

**poached egg**
: *A poached egg is an egg that has been cooked, outside the shell, by poaching (or sometimes steaming), as opposed to simmering or boiling liquid. This method of preparation can yield more delicately cooked eggs than cooking at higher temperatures such as with boiling water.*

The broken shells of **hundreds** of eggs slain in anger attest to how long it
took me to find the method described below.  Before the instant pot, I tried...

- swirling, simmering water (traditional)
- swirling, simmering oil or wine
- ridiculous plastic poachers that you microwave
- wrapping each egg in plastic wrap before poaching in water
- sous vide via my [anova device](https://www.amazon.com/Anova-Culinary-Precision-Bluetooth-Included/dp/B00UKPBXM4)

The Sous vide approach actually has merit but for speed and consistency, **the
instant pot is it**.
