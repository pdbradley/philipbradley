These days you can so quickly navigate to online (or local, using Dash) resources to get your syntax right that it may seem silly to emphasize memorization.

But the difference between knowing that something can be done, versus knowing how to do it at that moment, can mean the difference between one hour of coding and three.  (I just made those numbers up)

Especially when using something like Vim, where there are so many ways to do the same thing.  Some are inefficient, some are quite clever.  But if you don't know how to be clever, will you really stop to remind yourself?  Or just do it the old way.  I think we know the answer.

Anyway, that's why I like (and use) flashcards.  I want to transfer the little tricks I encounter into my active memory so that I can reach for them and find them when I need them.

I really love [ Practical Vim ](https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim) by Drew Neil.  I have converted some of the tips in his book into flashcards and my productivity in Vim reflects this.

Anyway onto the card sets.  Enjoy and if you benefit, leave a comment.  It gives me warm fuzzies.
